          Miklós was born in Csáktornya, Kingdom of Hungary (now Čakovec, Croatia)[5] to the Croatian Juraj V Zrinski
          and the Hungarian Magdolna (Magdalena) Széchy. At the court of Péter Pázmány, he was an enthusiastic student
          of Hungarian language and literature, although he prioritized military training. From 1635 to 1637, he
          accompanied Szenkviczy, one of the canons of Esztergom, on a long educative tour through the Italian
          Peninsula.

          art of war in defending the Croatian frontier against the Ottoman Empire, and proved himself one of the most
          important commanders of the age. In 1645, during the closing stages of the Thirty Years' War, he acted against
          the Swedish troops in Moravia, equipping an army corps at his own expense. At Szakolcza he scattered a Swedish
          division and took 2,000 prisoners. At Eger he saved the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand III, who had been
          surprised at night in his camp by the offensive of Carl Gustaf Wrangel. Although not enthusiastic for having
          to fight against Hungarians of Transylvania, subsequently he routed the army of George I Rákóczi, prince of
          Transylvania, on the Upper Tisza. For his services, the emperor appointed him captain of Croatia. On his
          return from the war he married the wealthy Eusebia Drašković.

          In 1646 he distinguished himself in the actions against Ottomans. At the coronation of Ferdinand IV of
          Austria, King of the Germans, King of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia, he carried the sword of state, and was
          made ban and captain-general of Croatia. In this double capacity he presided over many Croatian diets.

          During 1652–1653, Zrínyi was continually fighting against the Ottomans – nevertheless, from his castle at
          Csáktornya (Čakovec) he was in constant communication with the intellectual figures of his time; the Dutch
          scholar, Jacobus Tollius, even visited him, and has left in his Epistolae itinerariae a lively account of his
          experiences. Tollius was amazed at the linguistic resources of Zrínyi, who spoke Croatian, Hungarian, Italian,
          German, Ottoman Turkish and Latin with equal ease. Zrínyi's Latin letters (from which it was gathered that he
          was married a second time, to Sophia Löbl) are, according to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition of
          1911, "fluent and agreeable, but largely interspersed with Croatian and Magyar expressions". In a Latin letter
          from 1658 to friend Ivan Ručić expressed his consciousness of being an ethnic Croat and Zrinski ("Ego mihi
          conscius aliter sum, etenim non degenerem me Croatam et quidem Zrinium esse scio").[6][7]

          In 1655, he made an attempt to be elected Palatine of Hungary (nádor); in spite of support by the petty
          nobility, his efforts failed. The king, reacting to Zrínyi's good connections to Protestants and the
          Hungarians of Transylvania, nominated Ferenc Wesselényi instead
